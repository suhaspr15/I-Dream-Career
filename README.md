# I-Dream-Career
VTU 6th sem Mobile application Development Mini Project
The “IDreamCareer” app is specially created for students to help them make decisions about their future career and explore their options.
This application uses personality-based questionnaires to make predictions about potential career paths.
Personality assessment is done first to determine an individual's qualities and strengths, which can then be used to suggest appropriate career options.
The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths and preferences.
